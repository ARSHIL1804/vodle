        "p11": "vodle帮助团体做出公平和良好的决定。它能在任何一组选项中找到最大的部分共识。真正的民主，它给予每个人相同的有效影响。",
        "p12": "对于每个选项，它都会在右边的灯条上显示出当前的认可度，并允许你使用滑块实时调整你的评分。当你的滑块触及批准栏时，它就会变成绿色，表示你也批准该选项。这样一来，小组往往会趋向于达成尽可能广泛的全部或部分共识。",
        "p13": "当投票结束时，获胜的选项是由一个公平但简单的算法决定的，该算法给予每个投票者同样的影响，而不仅仅是那些碰巧处于多数的投票者。",
        "p14": "在<b>选择投票</b>中（你的小组要选择一个<b>选项</b>），决定是这样做出的。如果有一个选项被所有人认可，这个完全一致的选项将是肯定的赢家。否则，vodle最有可能宣布获得最广泛认可的选项为赢家。但为了实现公平，它有时也必须使用一定的机会，类似于绿卡抽签。",
        "p15": "vodle用于确定获胜选项的确切程序是这样的。投票结束后，选项按支持率降序排序，并通过抽签选出一名选民。该选民的滑块为绿色的最上面的选项被宣布为获胜者。",
        "p16": "这样一来，支持率最高的选项将有极大的获胜概率。其他选项的获胜概率最多就是它们的支持率（在所有不弃权的选民中的百分比）那么大。",
        "p17": "在<b>分配投票</b>中（你的小组将一些预算或资源分成若干目标或接受者的份额），程序是类似的：如果一个目标被所有的人批准，你有充分的共识，所以这个目标将得到全部的预算。否则，vodle会将预算的最大份额分配给得到最广泛认可的目标，而将较小的份额分配给其他目标。",
        "p18": "具体程序。目标按批准度降序排列。然后，每个目标的份额与支持该目标但不支持更高目标的选民人数成正比。",

        "h2": "谁在背后支持？",
        "p21": "vodle的算法（称为 “最大部分共识”）是由数学家Jobst Heitzig和Forest W. Simmons合作开发的，并对公平性进行了优化，灵感来自于著名社会学家Mark Granovetter的 “门槛模型”。这个应用程序是开源的，代码托管在<a href=\"{{github_url}}\" target=\"_blank\">github</a>上。主要开发者。约伯斯特-海茨格。贡献者。Marius Amrhein, Adrian Lison.",

At any moment in time while the poll runs, every voter approves some number of options – zero, one, or more than one. When the poll closes, the approval is used to determine the winner or budget shares in a way explained further down.",
        "p22": "But first: <i>How does your willingness to approve determine whether you actually approve an opton or not?</i> If you rate an option at 100, it means you definitely approve that option, and if you rate it at zero, you definitely don't approve that option.",
        "p23": "<i>But what if your rating of some option is somewhere between 0 and 100?</i> The main thing to understand is that whether or not you approve the option then <i>also</i> depends on the <i>other</i>  voters' willingness to approve that option! The main idea is that your “willingness to approve” rating is a kind of promise. By giving an option a rating larger than zero, you promise to approve that option <i>if enough other voters do so as well</i>. How many are “enough”? That depends on how far to the right you move your rating slider. If your rating is at, say, 83, that means you promise to approve the option if less than 83% of the voters <i>dis</i>approve the option – or, equivalently: if more than 17% of the voters <i>do</i> approve the option. In other words, the larger your rating, the fewer voters you require to also approve the option before you are willing to approve it as well.<br/> In the app, you can see very easily whether you currently approve an option, because we show you the percentage of current approvers as a light bar coming in from the right of the screen. If your slider, coming in from the left, meets that bar, then the percentage of voters not approving that option is lower than your rating, so your condition for approval is met and you are counted as approving the option. Your slider then turns from blue to green to indicate that you approve the option.",
        "p24": "Now that we have understood how approval is calculated, we can turn to the question of how the <b>winning probabilities</b> (budget shares) are found and how the actual winner is determined if the poll is about picking a single option. If exactly one option has 100% approval, it will win for sure (or get all of the budget). If several options each have 100% approval, the one among them that has the largest total rating will win for sure (or get all of the budget). If no option has 100% approval, <i>vodle</i> distributes the winning probability or budget among two or more options. In that case, the option with the largest approval will win most likely or get the largest share. But other options that have at least some approval may then win as well with some smaller probability, or also get some smaller share of the budget. For polls selecting a single option this means that then there is a certain chance element involved to determine the actual winner. This is because we must make sure that no group of voters can simply be ignored by the other voters as it is the case with majority rule. This way, <i>vodle</i> gives every voter the exact same influence and gives every faction an influence that matches its size.",
        "p25": "If the poll is about selecting one option, the exact procedure to find the winner when no option has 100% approval is very simple. One voter is determined by lot, everyone having the same chance of being that voter. Among the options that this voter approves, the one with the largest overall approval is the winner. The pie piece to the left of each option shows the resulting probability that this option wins.",
        "p26": "If the poll is about allocating a budget, the size of each option's shares is calculated the same way: the share is proportional to the number of voters that (i) approve this option but (ii) do not approve any other option that has a larger overall approval.",
        "p27": "So now we know how the winner or the shares are found. <b><i>But how should you now set your “willingness to approve” ratings?</i></b> The following rule of thumb usually works quite well to find a good consensus: <b>Give your favourite a rating of 100. Give all options which are better than average some rating larger than zero, scaling your ratings according to relative preference. Finally, give all options which are worse than average a rating of zero.</b>"
