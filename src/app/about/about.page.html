  <h3>What is vodle?</h3>
  <p>
    <b>vodle helps a group make fair and good decisions. 
      It finds the <i>maximal partial consensus</i> among any set of options.
      Truly democratic, it gives everyone the same effective influence.
    </b>
  </p>
  <p>
    For each option, it shows you the current support as a light bar on the right, 
    and allows you to adjust your ratings in realtime using sliders.
    When your slider touches the support bar, it turns green to indicate that you support that option as well.
    This way, the group tends to converge to a full or partial consensus as broad as possible. 
  </p>
  <p>
    When the poll closes, 
    the winning option is determined by a fair but simple algorithm that gives every voter the same influence,
    not just those voters who happen to belong to the majority.
  </p>
  <p>
    If one option is supported by all, this full consensus option will be the sure winner.
    Otherwise vodle most likely declares the option with the broadest support the winner.
    But to achieve fairness, it must sometimes also use a certain amount of chance,
    similar to a greencard lottery.
  </p>

    <p>
      The exact procedure that vodle uses for determining the winning option is this:
      After the poll has closed, options are sorted by descending support and one voter is picked by lot.
      The topmost option for which that voter's slider is green is declared the winner. 
    </p>
    <p>
      This way, the most supported option will have the vastly largest probability of winning,
      and every other option's winning probability is at most as large as its support.

  <h3>Who's behind it?</h3>
    <p>
      <i>vodle</i>'s algorithm was developed and optimizied for fairness by the mathematician Jobst Heitzig,
      inspired by the "threshold model" of famous sociologist Mark Granovetter.
      This app is open-source, authors: Jobst Heitzig and XXX with contributions by YYY.
