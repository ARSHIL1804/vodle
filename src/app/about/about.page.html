    <b><i>maxparc</i> helps groups find their <i>maximal partial consensus</i> among any set of options.</b>
  </p>
  <p>
    For each option, it shows you the current support as a grey bar on the right, 
    and allows you to adjust your ratings in realtime. 
    To help you converge to a full or partial consensus as broad as possible, 
    options are listed by descending support.
  </p>
  <p>
    When the poll closes, 
    the winning option is determined by a fair algorithm that gives every voter the same influence,
    not just those voters who happen to belong to the majority.
  </p>
  <p>
    If one option is supported by all, this full consensus option will be the sure winner.
    Otherwise <i>maxparc</i> most likely declares the option with the broadest support the winner.
    But to achieve fairness, it must sometimes also use a certain amount of chance,
    similar to a greencard lottery.
  </p>

    <p>
      The exact procedure that <i>maxparc</i> uses for determining the winning option is this:
      After the poll has closed, a voter is picked by lot.
      Then the topmost option for which that voter's rating knob overlaps with the grey support bar is declared the winner. 
    </p>
    <p>
      This way, the most supported option will have the vastly largest probability of winning,
      and all other options' winning probability is at most as large as their support.
