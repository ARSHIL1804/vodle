  <h3>What is vodle?</h3>
  <p>
    <b>vodle helps a group make fair and good decisions. 
      It finds the <i>maximal partial consensus</i> among any set of options.
      Truly democratic, it gives everyone the same effective influence.
    </b>
  </p>
  <p>
    For each option, it shows you the current support as a light bar on the right, 
    and allows you to adjust your ratings in realtime using sliders.
    When your slider touches the support bar, it turns green to indicate that you support that option as well.
    This way, the group tends to converge to a full or partial consensus as broad as possible. 
  </p>
  <p>
    When the poll closes, 
    the winning option is determined by a fair but simple algorithm that gives every voter the same influence,
    not just those voters who happen to belong to the majority.
  </p>

    For polls selecting a <i>single option,</i> the decision is made as follows.
    If one option is supported by all, this full consensus option will be the sure winner.
    Otherwise vodle most likely declares the option with the broadest support the winner.
    But to achieve fairness, it must sometimes also use a certain amount of chance,
    similar to a greencard lottery.
  </p>
  <small>
    <p>
      The exact procedure that vodle uses for determining the winning option is this:
      After the poll has closed, options are sorted by descending support and one voter is picked by lot.
      The topmost option for which that voter's slider is green is declared the winner. 
    </p>
    <p>
      This way, the most supported option will have the vastly largest probability of winning,
      and every other option's winning probability is at most as large as its support.

      For polls allocating <i>shares</i> of a budget to several options, the procedure is similar:
      If one option is supported by all, this full consensus option will get the full budget.
      Otherwise vodle allocates the largest share to the option with the broadest support,
      and smaller shares to the other options.
  </p>
  <small>
    <p>
      Exact procedure: Options are sorted by descending support. 
      Then each option's share is proportional to the number of voters who support this option but no higher-up option. 
    </p>

  <h3>Who's behind it?</h3>
    <p>
      <i>vodle</i>'s algorithm was developed and optimizied for fairness by the mathematician Jobst Heitzig,
      inspired by the "threshold model" of famous sociologist Mark Granovetter, in collaboration with Forest W. Simmons.
      This app is open-source, code hosted on <a href="https://github.com/mensch72/maxparc-ionic">github</a>, 
      authors: Jobst Heitzig and Marius Amrhein.

  <h3>Support vodle!</h3>
    <p>As we are committed to keep <strong>vodle</strong> free for everyone, we still need further help. If you are a nerd, creative, influencer, scientist, philanthropist, activist, politician, friendly alien... who believes in the future of fair &amp; efficient consensus making and want to contribute in whatever small way, we have some ideas <a href="https://sandstorm.pik-potsdam.de/assets/landing-page/index.html#support">how you might support us!</a></p>
