  <h3>How to vote</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Select a poll from <a routerLink="mypolls">My polls</a> or open a poll invitation that was sent to you.<br/>&nbsp;</li>
    <li>
      Rate the options by using the sliders.<br/>
      <small>
        A rating of, say, 80 means you would support this option if less then 80% oppose it
        (or, equivalently, if more than 20% support it).
        If your slider meets the light support bar to the right, then you support the option and the slider gets green.
      </small><br/>&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
      It is usually a good idea to give all those options a rating larger than zero that you consider better than average,
      and to give your favourite option a rating of 100.<br/>&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
      If you feel a good option is missing, just add it at the bottom of the list!<br/>
      <small>
        Options are sorted by descending support, so your option will move upwards as it gains support.
        <i>vodle</i> works best with at least a handful of options.
      </small><br/>&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
      The light bars to the right show current support, the pie charts to the left show current winning probabilities.
      See more information by pressing the dropdown buttons on the right.
