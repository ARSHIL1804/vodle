Issue unassigned

On poll page, user can click "delegate". This will open an email window with a delegation request containing a deep link that contains the poll-pw-encrypted private key of the user. User sends this email to the delegate, delegate opens the deep link, her vodle asks her to accept the delegation. When accepted, vodle uses other user's private key to register in that user's ballot file a delegation link to her own voter id. Until then, user's poll page says "delegation pending acceptance".

Note: this way both users learn each other's voter id!
