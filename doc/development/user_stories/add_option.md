on "poll" page, user can: 
- "add option" (round "+" button)
- enter metadata:
  - title
  - description
  - url
- "OK": will open a new mail window with preformatted subject and body
- "cancel"

on "poll" page, options added by others since last visit are highlighted as "new" and notified about ("There are new options, please scroll down and rate them!"). the "new" mark disappears once the user has clicked on it or rated the option.
